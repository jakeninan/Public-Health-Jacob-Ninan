Introduction :

This complex intervention framework provides an opportunity to focus on various aspects and monitor their impact on providing 
an intervention plan that can help maintain an individual's mental wellbeing (Peryer et al. 2022). It also deals with several interacting components responsible for creating an impact on human psychology. 
This study aims to discuss the mental health programs of the United Kingdom-based LGBTQ  community through education and 
employment opportunities and present an evaluation plan. Complex intervention frameworks and evaluation plans have also been 
considered for developing mental health programs for the LGBTQ community. Moreover,  the study also considered a range of factors for 
analysing the issue. 

********Complex intervention overview*************

Arranging mental health programs for the LGBTQ community through education and employment opportunities can be a complex intervention. 
The members of the LGBTQ   community belong to different races,  demographic,  socio-linguistics, 
and socio-cultural backgrounds (Berner et al. 2021). Hence,  
it can be a challenge to address all the mental health issues of each community member. 
The arrangement of mental health programs for the LGBTQ  community depends on several factors that can impact the members' mental health.
Social stereotypes are also responsible for creating a psychological impact on the community members (Patel, 2019). 
On the other hand, the lack of opportunities in society regarding education and employment has impacted mental wellbeing. 
The community members face critical challenges in social interaction, which also hampers their employment opportunities. 
Before arranging the mental health programs,  it is necessary to consider the economic factors,  social factors,  
communication gap,  education opportunities,  employment opportunities, and behavioural traits of the members of the 
LGBTQ community (Freeman, 2020). It is important to monitor the educational and employment requirements of the members to
help them gain confidence. Arranging mental health programs in public for the LGBTQ  community members can require 
the permission of the local authority (Kneale and Becares, 2020). Hence, the intervention plan is dependent on various factors and
can be regarded as a complex intervention. Following are the relevant contextual factors of the complex intervention plan :


****Economical factor********

Economic factors can also play a great role in implementing complex interventions for ensuring mental sustainability for the LGBTQ  
community members. It has been noticed that the annual income of the  LGBTQ  community members is significantly low in 
the United Kingdom. It can also impact their purchasing power in the country. This can also be a barrier to implementing the 
complex intervention plan. 
 

Figure 1: The purchasing power of LGBT  in a few countries in 2015
(Source: Statista Research Department, 2022)


The net disposable personal income of LGBT  community members in the United Kingdom was 150 billion US dollars, 
which is significantly less than Germany, China, and the USA (Statista Research Department, 2022). 
This highlights the lack of employment opportunities for the community members, and this also impacts their purchasing power 
in the country. Hence it is very important to arrange a mental health program for the  LGBTQ   community members through 
education and employment. It can help them to improve their employability in the United Kingdom and improve their mental sustainability.


******Social Factors*****

In society,  the LGBTQ  community members can hardly develop in interaction with society due to different social factors (Huang, 2021).
Inequality and gender discrimination can be the main reason for separating the LGBTQ community members from mainstream society, 
and for this reason, they feel left behind. This condition also raises depression and anxiety for the group members of the LGBTQ  
community. In many cases,  they can hardly receive common treatment and behaviour from society. They also face several problems in 
travelling (George, 2021). This also impacts their participation in different activities in society, leading to a lack of opportunities. 
Hence, the complex integration framework can provide them with an opportunity to improve their interaction in society. 


*******Communication Gap*************

Due to the lack of importance and attention in mainstream society,  the members of the LGBTQ  community have been facing a 
communication gap with society (Rubinsky and Hosek, 2020). The complex intervention framework focuses on providing better opportunities
to the community members to develop better communication with society and express their problems and solutions (Abdullayev, 2020).
It also allows enthusiastic people and volunteers to provide psychological support to the members. 
This can help restore the confidence and potential of the LGBTQ  community members. 
It can also help them to feel free about approaching an Employment opportunity in different organisations and companies in the UK.

*****Education and employment opportunities****

Education and employment opportunities can help LGBTQ community members to improve their knowledge and skills
(Nowaskie and Sowinski, 2018). It can allow them to develop their employability in the United Kingdom.
It also improves the purchasing power parity that can allow them to contribute to the economy of the country. 
An inclusive education policy can help LGBTQ  community members to attain the common classroom (Carlile, 2020). 
It can contribute to mental wellbeing and satisfaction. Through the complex intervention framework,  
the members of the LGBTQ community must be provided with an opportunity for education and employment in society for that improvement.

********Behavioural Traits***********

The members of the LGBTQ  community often feel uncomfortable interacting with other people in society. 
These behaviour traits have been impacting their performance and engagement in society and different activities.
Some members of the transgender group behave inappropriately in society, that can impact their communication (Bellhouse et al. 2018). 
Hence,  it is very important to provide them with education facilities so that they can understand the behavioural aspects.

******Strength and weakness of complex intervention*****

The main strength of the chosen complex intervention program is that it focuses on providing education and employment to the members of 
the LGBTQ community, and it can help them to improve their confidence and skills so that they can improve their employability in society
(Huchting and Fisher, 2019). On the other hand, several factors must be considered, such as social factors,  economic factors, 
communication gaps, and behaviour. Moreover,  permission from the authority is needed for arranging the mental health program. 
This can be the weakness factor.

************Evaluation plan************

An evaluation plan for a complex intervention program depends on several factors that are responsible for the development of the
research (Lambert et al. 2019). It focuses on reset perspective,  Research design,  range of factors for measurement,  
cost-effectiveness and the importance of relevant stakeholders and their contribution to the complex intervention project. 
It can help to monitor the growth of the complete intervention plan and its execution. 
This Complex intervention plan aims to provide mental health programs for the members of the LGBTQ community 
through employment and education in the United Kingdom. Different social factors and demographic factors are also responsible for 
impacting the complete intervention plan for the LGBTQ community. 
Following are the factors that are required for developing a complex intervention plan : 



*************Research perspective*******

Ensure the effectiveness of the complex intervention plan is the research perspective for improving the mental health problems of 
the LGBTQ community (Kohler et al. 2022). 
The effectiveness of this complete intervention plan is to provide a mental health program to the members of the LGBTQ community for 
improving their participation in society by creating job opportunities and education opportunities.
It can also enable them to contribute to the development of society and self-improvement.
Participation of the LGBTQ community members in different activities in society can help them interact with other people and get 
proper knowledge from society. 
It can develop effective communication between the members of the LGBTQ community and all the people in society. 
It can also encourage different NGOs to contribute to the development of the LGBTQ community of members. 
The complete intervention plan can create a positive impact on society by changing stereotypical views of the members of the
LGBTQ community. It can create strong cooperation and bonding between the local people and the LGBTQ community. 
This complete intervention framework can also help the LGBTQ community participate in mainstream society's activities 
(Epps, Markowski, and Cleaver, 2021). With the help of an inclusive education policy,  
it can be easier for the authority to provide education to the community members in a common classroom with other students.
 This helps the community members to regain confidence and avail all the opportunities in society. It also helps to provide mental sustainability to the LGBTQ community members through mental health programs and employment opportunities. On the other hand,  local administration can help them to improve their employability in society and find suitable job opportunities (Abelha et al. 2020).

***********Research design and rationale*********

An observational research design can be helpful for monitoring the details of the complete intervention plan for ensuring the 
mental health of the LGBTQ community by improving education and employability factors (Pingault et al. 2018). 
This research design can provide an opportunity to observe the characteristics of the participants in the mental health program.
In the mental health program,  the community members can be in different situations to improve their understanding and express 
their issues to the psychiatrist and psychologist. 
The participation technique and phenomena can highlight their behaviour and the intensity of the mental health problems. 
Moreover,  their reaction can help the psychiatrists to understand their mental health issues and the requirement for 
reducing the problems. The behaviour and skill of the community members can be observed through different activities during the 
conflict intervention program. An observational research design can provide an opportunity for the researcher to monitor the skills 
and communication process of the LGBTQ community members in society (Paneth and Joyner, 2021). 
This also highlights the behavioural traits of the community members.
The decision-making capabilities of the LGBTQ community and its members can be monitored in the complex intervention plan. 
This can allow cross-sectional interviews to identify the threat factors that can impact sustainability.
An observational research design focuses on a target population and case series. 
Case reports are important in observational research design. 
By observing the behaviour and decision-making capabilities of the LGBTQ community members, 
it can be helpful to record the necessary things for providing better facilities and opportunities to them. 
It also highlights the need to provide job opportunities and education to the community members to improve their skills and contribute to society (Mishima et al. 
2022). 

**********Range of factors required for measurement********

There are different ranges of factors that can determine the success of a complex intervention plan. 
Social behaviour and communication,  improvement in job opportunities and education for the LGBTQ community and skill 
improvement are the range of factors that can be chosen for the measurement in evaluation. Social behaviour and 
communication can play an important role in the evolution process. Social behaviour and communication can help the 
community members to establish a positive relationship with society. It can provide them with an opportunity to take part in 
different activities in society. This factor can provide efficient data to the complete intervention plan for making strategies.
It is also necessary to provide job opportunities to the LGBTQ community members (Taylor, 2018). Hence,  
it is important to monitor the available job opportunities for the community members that can help them to maintain sustainability.
Job opportunities can also help them to be independent. This is an important part of the evaluation incomplete intervention plan. 
Job satisfaction can provide mental satisfaction to the community members and can improve their psychological aspects 
(Hünefeld, Gerstenberg, and Hüffmeier, 2020). Besides monitoring the job opportunities in society, 
it is also important to monitor the available education opportunities for the community members. 
Education can improve their knowledge and skills that can contribute to the development of employability in society as an individual. 
It can reduce the stereotypical social views of the LGBTQ community members. 
Improvement in skill can contribute to the improvement of employability in society that can help them to find jobs in the 
United Kingdom. The behavioural traits are also important for monitoring the evaluation of the complex intervention plan for 
improving the mental health problems of the LGBTQ community members.

***********Cost-effectiveness measurement************

The cost-effectiveness of the complex intervention plan depends on the initiatives and programs, 
which are the important parts of this intervention framework (Vanness, Lomas, 
and Ahn, 2021). The complex intervention framework for improving the mental health of the
LGBTQ community members consists of awareness camps, 
free education through inclusive education policies of the United Kingdom government,  
mental health checkup by the psychiatrist and improving skills of the LGBTQ community members 
for improving their employability to get a job. These programs require a negligible amount,
but they can have a strong impact on society by improving different factors associated with the development of the LGBTQ community. 
The awareness camps can create awareness regarding the importance of education and improvement of the LGBTQ community in society. 
This can also help to reduce different misconceptions and stereotype thoughts about the LGBTQ community members in 
society and can provide them with an opportunity to participate in society.
This can boost the self-confidence of the community members and can help them to improve their communication skills and interact
with different people in society (Lawton, 2018). On the other hand, 
the role of a psychologist and psychiatrist can also contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the complex intervention plan. 
Volunteering participation of different medical and Healthcare executives can help to understand the mental
health issues of the community members while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the complex intervention plan. However,
the outcomes can highlight the success of the complex intervention plan that aims to provide better mental health to the LGBTQ
community by providing them education and employment opportunities in society.
Hence, the cost-effectiveness of this complex intervention plan is also dependent on the outcomes of this project.


*********Relevant stakeholders and their importance***********

The role of relevant stakeholders is also important for developing a complex intervention plan for providing mental stability to the
LGBTQ community. The government of the United Kingdom,  local education administration, NGOs, 
public bodies and the community head of the LGBTQ community of all relevant stakeholders in this complex intervention plan.
The Government of the United Kingdom is one of the most important stakeholders in the complex intervention plan (Maine, 2022). 
The policies regarding the development and education of the LGBTQ community and its members are dependent on the decisions of the 
government in the United Kingdom. It is also important to take permission from the government before
implementing the conflict intervention plan for the development of the LGBTQ community in the country. 
The local education administration is also important for implementing the inclusive education policy for the community members 
so that they can avail education in the common classroom with others. This can improve the knowledge about different subjects and 
improve the decision making capability. Different school and college authorities are also responsible for implementing inclusive 
education as a framework for providing education to the LGBTQ community members in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, 
NGOs can also play a critical role in arranging different activities that can help to improve the participation of the LGBTQ 
community members in society (Woulfe and Goodman, 2021). These non-government organisations are also responsible for developing 
communication between different stakeholders associated with the complex intervention land in the United Kingdom.
The participation of the community head of the LGBTQ community can help the authority to improve the engagement of the community
members in the complex intervention framework for improving their employability,  knowledge and skill for finding a job in the 
United Kingdom. However,  the support from the local administration and local bodies can also contribute to the development of a 
complex intervention plan to improve the mental health of the LGBTQ community. 


*********Conclusion***************

The assignment provided an opportunity to focus research on the mental health programs for the UK based LGBTQ community through varied
interventions,
including different education and employment opportunities. 
The assignment reflected that a complex intervention such as educational and employment opportunities will enable
the LGBTQ community to be empowered and will also help in addressing different mental health issues dealing with social stereotypes. 
It was also reflected that there are many factors such as there annual income discrimination communication gap and other behavioural
traits which are the major reasons for the mental issues in the LGBTQ community. An evaluation plan based upon the effective research
perspective and observational research have also been addressed above. Moreover, several measurements for a cost-effective framework,
including a negligible amount for checkups, have also been introduced while reflecting upon essential stakeholders such as the 
government NGOs and other public bodies.
